### This is the first implementation of the Cancer Dataset



--------------------------------------



So as a first approach i tried to do various steps in preprocessing like data cleaning, removing unwanted range of values, checking for outliers, solving outliers, solving null values, categorical encoding, scaling etc all are done in each steps one by one. 

So when these are encountered on a real life problem this method of solving those wont work. So as a next step i have started to approach this problem by using column transformer, introduction of pipelining here for ensuring a proper working and trying to balance the imbalance
