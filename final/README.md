## My final Conclusion

---



So when i started this Cancer prediction project,the [`initial file`](initial/initial.ipynb) was messy,as many lines of codes were repeating like in case of solving outliers i had manually write down each line of code to clean it,manuall solving the null values,manual model creation etc..

Then after doing that i have decided to make this much robust like make a proper workflow of it and decided to start again.

The [`2nd time trying`](initial/stillneedwork.ipynb) notebook, i have started to include proper columntransformation,pipeline to automate the workflow of solving the null values,scaling the data,handling the imbalance using smote etc and making them to a single final pipeline.

After that i decided to make this a little bit more cleaned. In The [`final notebook`](cancer_classification.ipynb), i was able to change the line by line cleaning of outliers,and more clean code comparing to the two

So next i am trying to solve more tasks and learn more things...🫡📈
